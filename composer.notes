"phpseclib/phpseclib" : "v2.0.11",

If this goes up to 3.x it seems to break - Test LTI Advantage and all
apects of LMSTest before assuming it works.

"firebase/php-jwt" : "v5.1.0"

In 5.2 they added a JWK class that has private parseKey() method.  We were 
using the "fproject/php-jwt" JWK class all this time and its parseKey()
method is public.  So we hold back until this is resolved - or perhaps
force load the fproject version in pre_config.php.
